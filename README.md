# Dominion Set Generator

This web app is made for people who are bored of playing with the same Dominion card sets. It
has a database to look for cards and filter them based on attributes. The libraries database has
a collection of card sets that my girlfriend and I found to be fun to play with. Currently
the generator generates sets based in initial choice and adds random cards. In the future it will use
an algorithm to select cards that play well together.

## The Database

The database page fetches all existing cards from the database and renders them as a grid. The search results can
be filtered based on name, cost, effects and types.

## The Library

The library page fetches all existing card sets and renders them as a grid. The card sets can be filtered based on title
and played cards.

## The Set Generator

The set generator page takes in cards and generates a set based on that choice.
