                        This web app is made for people who are bored of playing with the same Dominion card sets. It
                        has a database to look for cards and filter them based on attributes. The libraries database has
                        a collection of card sets that my girlfriend and I found to be fun to play with. The generator
                        is the heart of this app and uses a ... algorithm to find cards that play well in a set based on
                        set ratings.
